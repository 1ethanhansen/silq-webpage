Given classical bits $b \in 𝔹^n$ with $b[0]=1$, return state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Big(\ket{b}+\ket{0} \Big)$, where $\ket{0}$ is represented using $n$ bits.

### Solution

The following solution in particular leverages

- vectors (`𝔹^n`),
- Hadamard transform (`H`)
- inline conditionals (if-then-else)
- type annotations (`0:𝔹`)
- type casts (`as int[n]` and `as 𝔹^n`), and
- `forget`
