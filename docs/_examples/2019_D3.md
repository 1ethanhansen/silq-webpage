Implement a unitary operation on $n$ qubits which is represented by a square
matrix of size $2^n$ which has non-zero elements on both main diagonal and
anti-diagonal and zero elements everywhere else.

For example, for $n=3$, the matrix of the operation should have the following
shape:

```
X......X
.X....X.
..X..X..
...XX...
...XX...
..X..X..
.X....X.
X......X
```

Here, X denotes a "non-zero" element of the matrix, and . denotes a "zero"
element of the matrix.

The row and column indices of the matrix follow little endian format: The least
significant bit of the index is stored first in the qubit array. Thus, the
second column of the matrix gives you the coefficients of the basis states
you'll get if you apply the unitary to the $\ket{10...0}$ basis state.

### Solution

**Key insight**: A possible solution is mapping $\ket{b_1 \cdots b_n}$ to
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{b_1 \cdots b_n} \pm
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\overline{b_1} \cdots \overline{b_n}}$, where
$\overline{b_i}=1-b_i$. This is because the diagonal from top-left to
bottom-right captures the identity, and the diagonal from bottom-left to
top-right captures the mapping from $v$ to $N-v$ (where $N-v$ can be computed by
inverting all bits of $v$).

The following solution in particular leverages

- swapping entries of a vector with other values
